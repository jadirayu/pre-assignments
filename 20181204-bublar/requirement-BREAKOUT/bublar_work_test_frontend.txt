Bublar work test - Frontend
============================================

Time
----------
You have up to 7 days to code the game. 
It's very important that you document how many hours you worked.


Goal
--------
The goal is to create a Breakout game using Unity and C#. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)>
It's up to you how far you want to take the concept but the end result must include a paddle, bricks and a ball,
the ball should bounce off the walls, ceiling, paddle and bricks. Basically the game should contain the core mechanics of Breakout.

You will be judged on creativity as well, so feel free to add your own twists and ideas to the game.

We will supply the art assets needed, but feel free to create your own art.

When you're finished, zip your entire project and mail it to dev@bublar.com.

At the end write a short note on what you think you could improve and what parts you think you did best and want us to look at.
Swedish or English is fine.
